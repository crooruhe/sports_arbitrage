# sports_betting_arbitrage
Sports betting arbitrage program (Python)

This is a python program to compare two common online sports books to determine if there is an opportunity for arbitrage.
NOTE: it must be basketball season for this program to work

There is currently an issue with one of the sites and where it stores its JSON data, but the issue can only be resolved during the next basketball season
Thanks
